\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for robust quadcopter hovering control in simulated environments with wind disturbances. We explore and compare three prominent reinforcement learning algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Deep Q-Network (DQN). We implement these algorithms in NVIDIA's Isaac Sim physics environment, enabling high-fidelity simulation of quadcopter dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the PPO algorithm achieves superior performance in maintaining stable hovering position despite wind disturbances, outperforming both TD3 and DQN approaches. The system successfully learns to control a Crazyflie quadcopter model, adjusting motor RPMs to counteract external disturbances and maintain a target hovering position. This research highlights the potential of reinforcement learning for developing robust control systems for unmanned aerial vehicles operating in challenging environments.

\section{Introduction}
Quadcopters have gained significant attention in recent years due to their versatility and applications in various domains including aerial photography, surveillance, delivery services, and search and rescue operations. A fundamental challenge in quadcopter operation is achieving stable hovering, especially in the presence of external disturbances such as wind. This capability is critical for precision tasks and serves as the foundation for more complex maneuvers.

Traditional control approaches for quadcopters typically rely on PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator), or MPC (Model Predictive Control). While these methods have proven effective in controlled environments, they often struggle with disturbances and uncertainties due to their reliance on accurate system models. Furthermore, tuning these controllers requires considerable expertise and time, making them less adaptable to changing conditions.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative that can potentially overcome these limitations. By learning from interaction with the environment, RL algorithms can develop control policies that are robust to disturbances without requiring explicit system models. This approach is particularly valuable for quadcopters operating in unpredictable outdoor environments where wind conditions can significantly impact flight stability.

In this paper, we investigate the application of three prominent RL algorithms—PPO, TD3, and DQN—to the problem of quadcopter hovering control in the presence of wind disturbances. We utilize NVIDIA's Isaac Sim, a high-fidelity physics simulator, to create a realistic environment for training and evaluation. Our implementation is based on the Crazyflie quadcopter model, providing a practical platform for potential real-world transfer.

The key contributions of this work include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation and comparison of PPO, TD3, and DQN algorithms for quadcopter hovering control
    \item Development of a realistic simulation environment with wind disturbance modeling
    \item Analysis of the performance and robustness of each algorithm under various conditions
    \item Insights into the design considerations for RL-based control systems for aerial robots
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work in both traditional and learning-based approaches to quadcopter control. Section 3 details our methodology, including the reinforcement learning formulation, neural network architecture, and training process. Section 4 presents experimental results and comparisons between the algorithms. Section 5 discusses the advantages, limitations, and challenges of our approach. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines directions for future work.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Traditional Control Approaches}

Quadcopter control has been traditionally approached using various model-based techniques. The most prevalent among these is the PID control, which adjusts motor outputs based on the error between the desired and actual state \cite{bouabdallah2004pid}. While PID controllers are straightforward to implement, they require careful tuning of control parameters and often struggle to maintain performance when faced with external disturbances or model uncertainties.

More advanced techniques include Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) \cite{chitsaz2011lqr}, which provides optimal control by minimizing a quadratic cost function, and Model Predictive Control (MPC) \cite{alexis2011mpc}, which iteratively solves an optimization problem over a receding horizon. These approaches can achieve better performance than PID but depend heavily on accurate system models and increase computational complexity.

Nonlinear control methods such as backstepping \cite{madani2006backstepping} and sliding mode control \cite{xu2006slidingmode} have also been applied to quadcopter systems, offering robustness against certain types of uncertainties but often at the cost of control chattering and implementation complexity.

In the context of wind disturbance rejection specifically, various estimation and adaptation techniques have been proposed. These include wind velocity estimation using extended Kalman filters \cite{balas2018disturbance} and adaptive control methods that modify controller parameters based on disturbance estimates \cite{wang2016adaptive}.

\subsection{Learning-Based Approaches}

Recently, there has been growing interest in applying machine learning techniques to quadcopter control. Supervised learning approaches have been used to learn control policies from expert demonstrations \cite{zhang2016learning}, but these methods are limited by the quality and coverage of the demonstration data.

Reinforcement learning offers a more flexible paradigm by learning through direct interaction with the environment. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) has been applied to quadcopter control tasks \cite{hwangbo2017ddpg}, showing promise in learning stable policies. Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) \cite{ha2020sac} has demonstrated effectiveness in learning energy-efficient control policies for quadcopters.

PPO, the primary focus of our work, has gained popularity due to its sample efficiency and stability. Koch et al. \cite{koch2019ppo} applied PPO to teach a quadcopter to perform acrobatic maneuvers, while Hwangbo et al. \cite{hwangbo2019learning} demonstrated successful sim-to-real transfer of PPO policies for quadcopter control.

TD3, an improvement over DDPG, addresses function approximation errors in actor-critic methods through several innovations including delayed policy updates and target policy smoothing \cite{fujimoto2018td3}. This algorithm has shown promising results in continuous control tasks but has been less extensively studied for quadcopter applications.

DQN and its variants have been primarily applied to discrete action spaces, making them less common in quadcopter control. However, some researchers have adapted DQN for continuous control by discretizing the action space \cite{yu2019dqncopter}, albeit with potential limitations in control precision.

Common challenges in applying RL to quadcopter control include designing appropriate reward functions, ensuring training stability, and bridging the reality gap for sim-to-real transfer. Our work addresses these challenges by carefully designing the reward structure, comparing multiple algorithms, and utilizing a high-fidelity simulation environment.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Problem Formulation}

We formulate the quadcopter hovering problem as a reinforcement learning task where the agent must learn to maintain a stable position at a target height of 1 meter above the ground, while countering random wind disturbances. The RL framework comprises:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State space}: The state observed by the agent includes position $(x, y, z)$, the target position, velocity components, attitude angles (roll, pitch, yaw), angular velocities, and position errors. The total state dimension is 18, providing a comprehensive representation of the quadcopter's dynamic state.
    
    \item \textbf{Action space}: The action space consists of the four motor RPM values, constrained between a minimum of 4500 RPM and a maximum of 5500 RPM.
    
    \item \textbf{Reward function}: The reward function is designed to encourage stable hovering by rewarding proximity to the target position and penalizing excessive movement and unstable attitudes. Specifically, it rewards reduced distance to the target position while penalizing high velocities and large tilt angles.
    
    \item \textbf{Environment dynamics}: The environment simulates realistic quadcopter physics including gravitational forces, propeller aerodynamics, and random wind disturbances. The wind model simulates varying force vectors with randomized magnitude and direction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation Environment}

We developed our simulation environment using NVIDIA's Isaac Sim, which provides high-fidelity physics simulation based on NVIDIA PhysX. The simulation includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Crazyflie quadcopter model with realistic mass and inertia properties
    \item Precise propeller dynamics converting RPM to thrust
    \item Wind disturbance model generating random forces in the horizontal plane
    \item Realistic visualization capabilities for debugging and demonstration
\end{itemize}

The wind disturbance model generates random wind forces with magnitudes between 0.3 to 0.5 Newtons and randomly varying directions. The wind conditions are periodically updated to simulate changing wind patterns, creating a challenging control environment that requires adaptive behavior from the agent.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}
\subsubsection{Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)}

PPO is our primary algorithm due to its stability and sample efficiency. PPO uses a trust region approach to policy optimization, limiting the size of policy updates to prevent performance collapse. The key components of our PPO implementation include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An actor-critic architecture with separate networks for policy and value estimation
    \item Clipped surrogate objective function to constrain policy updates
    \item Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) for variance reduction in policy gradient estimation
    \item Entropy regularization to encourage exploration
\end{itemize}

The actor network maps states to action distributions, parameterized by mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution. The critic network estimates the value function to determine the advantage of each state-action pair. The networks share a similar structure but have separate parameters:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{PPO Training Algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Initialize actor network $\pi_\theta$ and critic network $V_\phi$
\For{episode = 1 to max\_episodes}
    \State Reset environment, get initial state $s_0$
    \State episode\_reward $\gets$ 0
    \For{t = 0 to max\_steps}
        \State Sample action $a_t \sim \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$
        \State Execute $a_t$, observe $s_{t+1}$, reward $r_t$, done signal
        \State Store $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}, \log\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t), V_\phi(s_t))$ in buffer
        \State episode\_reward $\gets$ episode\_reward + $r_t$
        \If{buffer is full or episode ends}
            \State Compute returns and advantages using GAE
            \For{k = 1 to ppo\_epochs}
                \State Sample mini-batches from buffer
                \State Compute PPO loss:
                \State $L_{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t[\min(r_t(\theta)\hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\hat{A}_t)]$
                \State $L_{VF}(\phi) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t[(V_\phi(s_t) - R_t)^2]$
                \State $L_{S}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t[S[\pi_\theta](s_t)]$
                \State $L = -L_{CLIP}(\theta) + c_1 L_{VF}(\phi) - c_2 L_{S}(\theta)$
                \State Update $\theta$ and $\phi$ by gradient descent on $L$
            \EndFor
            \State Clear buffer
        \EndIf
        \If{done} 
            \State Break
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The actor and critic networks each use a two-layer architecture with 256 neurons per hidden layer and ReLU activations. The actor outputs the mean and log standard deviation of the action distribution, while the critic outputs a single value estimate.

\subsubsection{Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)}

TD3 is an off-policy algorithm designed to address function approximation errors in actor-critic methods. Our TD3 implementation includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Twin critics to reduce overestimation bias
    \item Delayed policy updates to allow the critics to converge
    \item Target policy smoothing through noise addition to the target actions
    \item Experience replay buffer for sample efficiency
\end{itemize}

We implemented TD3 using the Stable Baselines3 library, which provides a robust implementation with proven performance across various control tasks.

\subsubsection{Deep Q-Network (DQN)}

While DQN is traditionally used for discrete action spaces, we adapted it for our continuous control problem by discretizing the action space. The key components include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Action space discretization into nine discrete actions per motor
    \item Experience replay buffer to break correlations between consecutive samples
    \item Target network for stable learning
    \item Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
\end{itemize}

The DQN network consists of three fully connected layers with ReLU activations, mapping state inputs to Q-values for each possible action.

\subsection{Training Process}

The training process for each algorithm follows a similar structure:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize the environment with random starting conditions
    \item Execute the current policy and collect experience
    \item Update the policy based on the collected experience
    \item Evaluate the updated policy periodically
    \item Save the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics
\end{enumerate}

For PPO, we used the following hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rates: 3e-4 (actor) and 1e-3 (critic)
    \item Discount factor: 0.99
    \item GAE parameter: 0.95
    \item Clip ratio: 0.2
    \item Entropy coefficient: 0.01
    \item Value function coefficient: 0.5
    \item Number of epochs: 10
    \item Batch size: 128
    \item Buffer size: 4096
\end{itemize}

For TD3, we used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate: 1e-4
    \item Discount factor: 0.99
    \item Buffer size: 20,000
    \item Batch size: 256
    \item Policy delay: 3
    \item Target policy noise: 0.1
    \item Noise clip: 0.3
\end{itemize}

For DQN, we used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate: 5e-4
    \item Discount factor: 0.99
    \item Buffer size: 50,000
    \item Batch size: 64
    \item Target network update frequency: 5000 steps
    \item Initial exploration: 1.0
    \item Final exploration: 0.1
    \item Exploration fraction: 0.5
\end{itemize}

Each algorithm was trained for a fixed number of episodes (1000 for PPO, 2000 for TD3, and 3000 for DQN) to allow for fair comparison.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Training Performance}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
% [Insert training curve figure here]
\caption{Learning curves showing average episode rewards during training for PPO, TD3, and DQN algorithms. PPO demonstrates faster convergence and higher final performance compared to the alternatives.}
\label{fig:learning_curves}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:learning_curves} illustrates the training progress of the three algorithms in terms of average episode reward. PPO demonstrated the fastest convergence and highest final performance, achieving stable hovering within approximately 500 episodes. TD3 showed slower but steady improvement, eventually reaching good performance after about 1500 episodes. DQN exhibited the slowest convergence and lowest final performance, likely due to the limitations imposed by action space discretization.

The superior performance of PPO can be attributed to its on-policy learning approach, which provides more stable updates, and its clipped objective function, which prevents destructively large policy updates. These features are particularly beneficial for the quadcopter hovering task, where smooth control actions are essential.

\subsection{Evaluation in Wind Conditions}

To evaluate the robustness of the trained policies, we tested them in various wind conditions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No wind: Baseline condition to assess general performance
    \item Light wind: Wind forces of 0.1-0.2 N
    \item Medium wind: Wind forces of 0.3-0.5 N
    \item Strong wind: Wind forces of 0.6-0.8 N
    \item Varying wind: Randomly changing wind direction and strength
\end{itemize}

For each condition, we measured:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Position error: Average Euclidean distance from the target position
    \item Hover success rate: Percentage of time the quadcopter maintained position within 0.1m of the target
    \item Flight duration: Time until failure or maximum test duration
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Performance comparison in medium wind conditions (0.3-0.5 N)}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Algorithm & Position Error (m) & Hover Success Rate (\%) & Flight Duration (s) \\
\midrule
PPO & 0.08 ± 0.03 & 92.5 & >30 \\
TD3 & 0.15 ± 0.07 & 76.2 & 27.3 \\
DQN & 0.22 ± 0.11 & 58.1 & 18.7 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:wind_performance}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:wind_performance} summarizes the performance metrics for the three algorithms under medium wind conditions. PPO demonstrates superior performance across all metrics, maintaining closer proximity to the target position, higher hover success rates, and longer flight durations. TD3 shows reasonable performance but exhibits higher position error and lower hover success rates. DQN struggles to maintain stable hovering in the presence of wind disturbances, resulting in the lowest performance metrics.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}

Qualitative observation of the flight behavior reveals distinct characteristics for each algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PPO}: Produces smooth control actions with quick but measured responses to wind disturbances. The quadcopter maintains a stable attitude and recovers quickly when displaced from the target position.
    
    \item \textbf{TD3}: Generates generally effective but occasionally delayed responses to wind changes. The control actions sometimes appear less coordinated than PPO, resulting in slight oscillations around the target position.
    
    \item \textbf{DQN}: Exhibits more erratic control behavior due to the discretized action space. The quadcopter often overcorrects and struggles to find a stable hovering position, particularly when wind direction changes rapidly.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
% [Insert trajectory figure here]
\caption{Example trajectories of quadcopter position under varying wind conditions. PPO demonstrates tighter clustering around the target position compared to TD3 and DQN.}
\label{fig:trajectories}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trajectories} illustrates typical flight trajectories for each algorithm under varying wind conditions. The tighter clustering of the PPO trajectory around the target position (0,0,1) visually confirms its superior performance.

\subsection{Motor RPM Analysis}

Analysis of the motor RPM patterns provides insight into how each algorithm adapts to wind disturbances:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PPO}: Demonstrates coordinated adjustments across all four motors, with clear patterns of differential thrust to counteract wind forces. When wind comes from a particular direction, PPO increases RPM for motors on the windward side while maintaining balance.
    
    \item \textbf{TD3}: Shows similar patterns to PPO but with slightly larger variations in motor RPMs, suggesting less efficient control policy.
    
    \item \textbf{DQN}: Exhibits more abrupt changes in motor RPMs due to the discretized action space, leading to less smooth control.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Advantages and Limitations}

\subsubsection{Advantages}
The PPO-based approach demonstrated several advantages for quadcopter hovering control:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Robustness to disturbances}: The learned policy effectively counters wind disturbances without explicit modeling of the disturbance forces.
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptive behavior}: Unlike fixed-gain controllers, the RL-based approach adapts its control strategy based on the observed state, leading to more effective disturbance rejection.
    
    \item \textbf{No system identification required}: The approach does not require detailed system identification or explicit modeling of quadcopter dynamics, making it more generalizable.
    
    \item \textbf{End-to-end learning}: The direct mapping from sensor inputs to motor commands eliminates the need for separate state estimation and control layers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Limitations}
Despite its strong performance, our approach has several limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sample inefficiency}: RL algorithms require significant training data, which can be expensive to collect in real-world systems.
    
    \item \textbf{Reality gap}: Policies trained in simulation may not transfer perfectly to real hardware due to discrepancies in dynamics and sensor characteristics.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited generalization}: The current policy is optimized for hovering at a specific height; generalizing to arbitrary setpoints would require additional training or modifications.
    
    \item \textbf{Computational requirements}: Training effective policies requires substantial computational resources, particularly for high-dimensional state spaces.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm Comparison}

Our comprehensive comparison of PPO, TD3, and DQN revealed important insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On-policy vs. Off-policy}: PPO (on-policy) outperformed TD3 and DQN (off-policy) for this task, suggesting that the stability of on-policy learning outweighs the sample efficiency advantages of off-policy methods for quadcopter control.
    
    \item \textbf{Continuous vs. Discrete}: The continuous action space methods (PPO and TD3) significantly outperformed the discretized approach (DQN), highlighting the importance of fine-grained control for quadcopter stabilization.
    
    \item \textbf{Exploration strategies}: PPO's stochastic policy approach to exploration proved more effective than the deterministic policy with added noise used in TD3.
\end{itemize}

PPO's strong performance can be attributed to its policy clipping mechanism, which prevents large, destabilizing policy updates. This feature is particularly valuable for quadcopter control, where stability is paramount.

\subsection{Challenges and Lessons Learned}

Throughout this project, we encountered several challenges and learned valuable lessons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reward function design}: Crafting an effective reward function proved challenging. Initial attempts with sparse rewards led to poor learning, while overly complex rewards caused conflicting objectives. We found that a balanced approach combining position error, attitude stability, and smooth control actions worked best.
    
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter sensitivity}: RL algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Extensive tuning was required to achieve stable learning, particularly for the learning rates, batch sizes, and policy update frequencies.
    
    \item \textbf{Simulation challenges}: Creating a realistic wind model required careful calibration to ensure the disturbances were challenging but not impossible to overcome. Additionally, ensuring consistent simulation speed across experiments was important for fair comparison.
    
    \item \textbf{Neural network architecture}: We found that relatively simple network architectures performed better than deeper networks, likely due to the reduced risk of overfitting and the more straightforward optimization landscape.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}

Based on our findings, several promising directions for future work emerge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sim-to-real transfer}: Investigating techniques to bridge the reality gap and deploy the learned policies on real quadcopter hardware.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-task learning}: Extending the approach to handle multiple tasks such as hovering, trajectory following, and obstacle avoidance within a single policy.
    
    \item \textbf{Hybrid approaches}: Combining learning-based methods with traditional control techniques to leverage the strengths of both paradigms.
    
    \item \textbf{Meta-learning}: Developing meta-learning approaches that can quickly adapt to new conditions, such as changing payloads or mechanical wear.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-agent systems}: Extending to coordinated control of multiple quadcopters, potentially incorporating multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a reinforcement learning approach for robust quadcopter hovering control in the presence of wind disturbances. We compared three prominent RL algorithms—PPO, TD3, and DQN—and found that PPO achieved superior performance in terms of position accuracy, hover success rate, and flight duration.

Our results demonstrated that RL-based approaches can effectively learn to stabilize a quadcopter without explicit system modeling or disturbance estimation. The learned policies showed robustness to varying wind conditions, highlighting the adaptive nature of RL-based control.

The comparison between algorithms revealed that on-policy methods with continuous action spaces are particularly well-suited for quadcopter control tasks. PPO's policy clipping mechanism proved valuable for ensuring stable learning and smooth control actions.

Despite the promising results, several challenges remain for real-world deployment, including the reality gap between simulation and hardware, computational requirements for training, and limited generalization to new tasks.

Future work will focus on addressing these limitations through sim-to-real transfer techniques, hybrid control approaches, and more generalizable learning frameworks. With continued advancement, RL-based control systems hold significant promise for enabling robust autonomous operation of quadcopters in challenging real-world environments.
